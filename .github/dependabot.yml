  # Zig dependencies (via build.zig.zon)
  # Note: Dependabot doesn't natively support Zig yet, but this structure
  # is ready for when support is added or for custom automation
  # For now, manual updates are required for build.zig.zon dependencies

# Additional configuration for future use:
#
# When Zig package manager support is added to Dependabot, or when using
# a custom solution, monitor these files:
# - build.zig.zon (package dependencies)
# - build.zig (build system updates)
#
# Manual dependency update process:
# 1. Check for Zig updates: https://ziglang.org/download/
# 2. Review build.zig.zon for package updates
# 3. Test with: zig build test
# 4. Update version in workflows if Zig version changes
#
# Recommended update schedule:
# - Zig toolchain: Monthly (stable releases), or as needed for bug fixes
# - Dependencies in build.zig.zon: Weekly review, update as needed
# - GitHub Actions: Automated via this config

# Security updates
# Dependabot will automatically create PRs for security updates
# regardless of the schedule configuration above
